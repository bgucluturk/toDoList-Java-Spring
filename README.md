# toDoList-Java-Spring
toDoList Java Spring, H2 Database, Docker Compose

-- The web services of the todolist project were made as basic operations (CRUD), and DTO classes were customized.
H2 was used as the database and the swagger library was added. 
In principle, Prototype, Singleton, Builder, Abstract Factory, Factory Method, Objected Pool were used.
Love and numbers to everyone.
